In every forest there is a cabin. In every cabin there is a stove. In every stove there is an ash pile. In every ash pile there is a bone. In every bone there is a story. In every story there is a yearning. In every yearning there is a prize. In every prize there is a cost. In every cost there is a cut. In every cut there is a ghost. In every ghost there is a home. In every home there is a witch. In every witch there is a girl. In every girl there is a forest.
